To contribute to the list of publications, please follow the instructions below:

1\. Go to ['PRL/PublicationsList'](https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/PublicationsList) repository in GitHub.

2\. Update the corresponding YAML file(s) in the 'publications' directory with your contributions.

**Warning:** Entries are numbered sequentially in reverse chronological order. For articles, the ID field is currently deprecated and can be omitted; however, it can still be used to set a specific number to an article.
{: .notice--warning}

**Note:** Please be observative that years are not automatically collected from entries, so make sure to add a 'bumpyear' entry between articles of different years.
{: .notice--info}

3\. After updating the YAML file(s), commit the changes to the main branch, and you're good to go! The list will soon be automatically updated in the [PRL Publications List](https://phasesresearchlab.github.io/PublicationsList/).
